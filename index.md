## Grading

The grade will count the assessments using the following proportions:
* __30%__ of your grade will be determined by the class project, including:
  * Project Proposal (5%)
  * Project Report (15%)
  * Final Presentation (10%)
* __20%__ of your grade will be determined by the mid-term exam. 
*	__15%__ of your grade will be determined by Assignment 1.
* __15%__ of your grade will be determined by Assignment 2.
*	__15%__ of your grade will be determined by Assignment 3.
*	__5%__ of your grade will be determined by your participation. Student who finish the class project, the mid-term exam, and all assignments will receive the full credits of participation.
